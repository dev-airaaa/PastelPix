# PastelPix

a cozy pixel art editor built for intuitive creation, chaotic charm, and future animation dreams.

## Why I Made This

Because pixel art deserves a space that feels like home.  
Because sometimes you just want to draw a frog in 16x16 and not fight your tools.  
Because creative burnout is real, and cozy editors help.

PastelPix is a love letter to intuitive design, emotional UX, and the kind of tools that make you feel seen.
